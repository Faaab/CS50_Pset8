# Mashup
This final problem set for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science is called Mashup. This is a web app that takes information from both Google News and Google Maps and displays articles on top of a map.
Because the file was rather large, I excluded the database (with full-text search support) that I created for this project. If you would want to try this project for yourself, you would need to create another such database.

NB: The CS50 staff has provided a portion of the code for this problem set. My own code can be found in:
1. application.py -> The 'articles' and 'search' functions
2. static/scripts.js -> The 'configure', 'addMarker' and 'removeMarkers' functions
